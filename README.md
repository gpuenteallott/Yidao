Yidao
=====

Yidao is a project of social network that @abadabanaes ( https://github.com/abadabanades ) and I  developed.
We had the idea to create a social network to arrange meetings to teach and learn in pairs.
Just like CouchSurfing for travelling, Yidao for learning.

The concept is really beautiful. We had the idea one day after chinese class.
Since that moment, we decided that it wouldn't be just a dream but we would take iniciative and make it true.
We spent a few months working on it.
We even got to collabore with another student, @garcianavalon ( https://github.com/garcianavalon ), who had more 
experience in database design and helped us with that.

When we realized that we weren't putting enough effort and that we were going to live in different countries in
just a few months, we decided to quit the project.

It was a great project, we experimented, learnt and collaborated.

The code is now free so anyone can learn from it.

All the code was developed between January and May of 2013.
